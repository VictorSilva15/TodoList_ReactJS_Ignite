Hello everybody, here I keep my code developed during the first challenge from Ignite platform (rocketseat). Basically I built a simple todo list using typescript and sass. The template was simple and beautiful, but after apply the main functionalities I wanted to let the application more unique, so I change the colors besides to apply responsiveness.

## Requirements and How to use

To run this application locally you just need to install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) in your computer. By doing that npm (node package manager) will be installed too. So know you can start the application by running:

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Start the application
npm run dev

# apply tests
npm test
```

If you prefer you can run by using `yarn` instead:

```bash
# Install yarn in computer globally
npm install yarn --global

# Install all dependencies with yarn
yarn

# Start the application with yarn
yarn dev

# apply tests with yarn
yarn test
